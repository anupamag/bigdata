Using Random forest the accuracy of the model was high close to 90. [More rows/records and Replace = True]
------------------------------------
pandas helps fill this gap, enabling you to carry out your entire data analysis workflow in Python without 
having to switch to a more domain specific language like R.

Combined with the excellent IPython toolkit and other libraries, the environment for doing data analysis in 
Python excels in performance, productivity, and the ability to collaborate.

pandas does not implement significant modeling functionality outside of linear and panel regression; 
for this, look to statsmodels and scikit-learn. More work is still needed to make Python a first class statistical 
modeling environment, but we are well on our way toward that goal.
