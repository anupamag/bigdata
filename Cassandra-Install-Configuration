Install Cassandra

1]Installed openJDK7 - Preferred is Oracle Java but it is dictated by DataStax edition of Cassandra. I have stuck to OpenJDK as it is in sync with our Hadoop cluster.

2]Referred to page http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/DebianPackaging
to install cassandra
----------------------
Adding packages to repo.list
----------------------------
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://www.apache.org/dist/cassandra/debian 21x main" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cassandra.list'

sudo sh -c 'echo "deb-src http://www.apache.org/dist/cassandra/debian 21x main" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cassandra.list'


3]Referred to page https://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/GettingStarted for starting cassandra

start up Cassandra by invoking 'bin/cassandra -f 
If you start up Cassandra without the "-f" option, it will run in the background. You can stop the process by killing it, using 'pkill -f CassandraDaemon'
