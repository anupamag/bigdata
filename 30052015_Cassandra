Commands

Integration with Hadoop

migration of data from mysql to cassandra
how it can be done.

MR job with cassandra - does this require a copy to hdfs from cassandra to 

cassandra read v/s write
advantages

ex: vertica - compression/ sorted,

does cassandra provide capability to store data in a stored/compressed/sorted data.
integrated compression, leveled compaction
enforced via foreign keys/referential integrity constraints.
CAP Theorem - 
a NoSQL data model easily handles such situations and delivers very fast performance for both read and write operations.
