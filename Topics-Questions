Map Reduce Operations - Working
What isResource Manager and Node Manager
Mapper Reducer Ratio. Are they equal? which is configurable
Scenario - Mapper has completed job, 3 reducers have completed, one reducer is still running. More workload on this reducer. Reasons for this?
Scenrio - When there is 1TB data file, will the number of Mapper and Reducers be same while processing 1TB data file(no compression) and when 1TB compressed file is there
Hive  - difference b/w external and internal table
Metastore and Partitio
Linux  -system process is taking lot of memory. Reason for this? remedy for this?
